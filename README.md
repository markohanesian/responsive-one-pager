## Description
A custom built, modern, responsive, one-pager style website template built with HTML and CSS, utilizing Flexbox properties desktop and mobile readability

## User Story
I need a responsive, modern, sleek website layout that is lightweight in code and easy to customize. Full-stack web application frameworks are simply overkill for my intended web use for this particular project. I want to be able to make simple modifications to the CSS styling to be able to easily customize this web template to my brand/project.

## Instructions
Clone to your  local repository and open the styles.css file to customize your theme. Edit the index.html file for layout changes. NOTE: Icons from Fontawesome have been used as logo placeholders - to customize, sign up at [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
